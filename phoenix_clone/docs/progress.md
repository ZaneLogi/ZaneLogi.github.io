# Progress — phoenix_clone

Implementation tracker for the Phoenix HTML5/ES6 port. The 9-step plan
is defined in [`research_code_flow.md` §5.4](research_code_flow.md);
this doc records what's been built against it and what's next.

Sibling docs:
- `../CLAUDE.md` — per-project conventions
- `research_*.md` — domain research (currently-true content only)
- `../architecture.html` *(planned)* — code-flow map / resume diagram

## Legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅   | Done |
| 🚧   | In progress — sub-tasks listed below |
| ⏳   | Pending — not started |
| ⏸️   | Deferred (intentional) |

## Steps

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Tile decode + render skeleton (player ship visible) | ✅ | `state.player` placeholder draws via `gfx.drawObject`; tile-ROM decoded into `resource.fgTileImages[]`/`bgTileImages[]`; debug overlay (`G` key) cycles fg/bg sheets |
| 2 | Cold-init path (`$0008` → `InitSoundScreen` → `PrintTextLines`) | ✅ | Three T1800 score / coin rows render at boot before any state-machine ticks. Static-text-table format documented in `research_rendering.md` §4.3; build pipeline extracts T1800 from `maincpu.bin` via `tools/build_data.py`. |
| 3 | Background tile-grid + scrolling | ⏳ | `state.bgTiles[]`, `state.bgScrollY`, `drawBackground()` first then FG on top |
| 4 | Input poll + main-loop skeleton (empty handlers) | ✅ | State 0/1/2/3 timing matches L0430/L04AC/L0515/L0800 (state 1 = 128 frames; per L04BD Counter9A is zeroed every state-1 frame except the $7F first iteration). Score-flash paints/erases the active player's 6 digits via `scoring.printNumber`/`eraseDigits` based on bit 3 of CounterA5 (L04C4); `UpdateScoresAndSound` (L2700) wired as a stub — buffer at $4370-$437F is empty until enemies hit, sound deferred. Coin debounce (WaitVBlankCoin tail) lands with attract mode. |
| 5 | State 0 → 1 (score flash) → 2 (stage 0 init) → 3 (stage 0 fade-in → stage 1 sit) | ✅ | State 2 ports L0515 chain: $0580 InitGlobalLevelData (T0598 + STAGE_BLOCKS), $0547 InitPlayerDataStructure (T0560 → player x/y), $0532 alien-data init ($05EC T1500 → controlA/B, $0650 T1520 move-ptr carried unused, $0610 T063A → T1540+ formation lookup). State 3 dispatches JT4; stage 0 ports L0834 fade-in (counterB4 decrement, GetAnimationChrs walks controlB through $6C/$6D/$6E/$6F/$68 in 4-frame phases below counterB4=$15, L05FA per-frame all-alien rewrite, L0848 stage-clear → LevelAndRound++ + GameState=2). Stage 1 (L2000) is a no-op stub — aliens sit in formation with controlA=$09 controlB=$60 (T1420 shape #1) until step 6. Render dispatch mirrors Bit3Controller: low3=0 Draw 1×1 (controlB raw, fade-in), low3=1 Draw 2×1 (T1420[controlB..+1] horizontal), 3 Draw 1×2, 4 Draw 2×2. Player.alive guards drawing until state 2 runs. Deferred: $06F0 background scroll → step 3 (stub means screen stays black for the first ~$EA frames of stage 0); alien motion and T1520 consumption → step 6; player input/fire and L2000 body → step 7; attack swoops → step 8. |
| 6 | Stage 0 alien fade-in (`$0834`) | ⏳ | Pulls in still-open enemy-motion research |
| 7 | Player movement + bullet (`PlayerUpdate $0876`) | ⏳ | Pulls in still-open player-mechanics research |
| 8 | Alien combat (state 3 stage 1, `$2000`) + AABB collision | ⏳ | Pulls in `research_rendering.md` §6 |
| 9 | Birds (`$3400`) + mothership (`$22B4`/`$22CA`) + shield-block tile-swapping | ⏳ | Pulls in still-open mothership research |
| – | Sound (MN6221AA bit-field synthesis) | ⏸️ | Per `research_hardware.md` §5; only matters for audio fidelity |

## Open research (gating future steps)

- **Enemy motion / attack patterns** — gates step 6
- **Player mechanics + shield** — gates step 7
- **Mothership stage** — gates step 9

## Conventions for editing this doc

- Update in the same commit as the code/doc change being tracked.
- Don't cite commit SHAs — `git log --grep="step N"` is the authoritative answer to "when was X done." SHAs in checked-in docs go stale on rebases.
- Sub-task breakdowns live only for steps in 🚧 status; remove once the step closes.
- Deviations from the research docs go under the affected step row, then trigger a research-doc update in the same commit (research docs are currently-true only).
