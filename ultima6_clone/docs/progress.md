# progress — ultima6_clone

The implementation-step ledger (matches `asteroids_clone` / `phoenix_clone`
convention: numbered `I-N` steps, each with a "scope" subsection carrying the
per-sub-step notes that don't fit a commit body). Research-side truth lives in
`research_*.md`; the architecture the steps build to is `architecture_ecs.md`.

**Status:** **I-1 (terrain on screen) COMPLETE** — the first vertical slice through
the ECS runtime ground (`architecture_ecs.md`) renders Britain (terrain + animated
water + coastlines) and a few `Position`+`Renderable` entities on real U6 data,
drag-pannable. Next: **I-2** — the world-data system (load `OBJBLK*`/`objlist` into
real ECS entities), the clone's core ECS validation.

## Step ledger

| Step | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **I-1** | **terrain on screen** (ECS core + overworld render + demo entities) | **done** |
| **I-2** | **world-data system** — load `OBJBLK*` objects + `objlist` NPCs into real ECS entities (drawn + spatial-indexed; `ObjManager` dissolved) | **next** |
| I-3 | world clock (game-time tick → schedules / day-night) | planned |
| I-4 | tile passability (walkability primitive; reused by NPC + avatar) | planned |
| I-5 | NPC scheduled movement (hourly schedules + pathfinding + walking) | planned |
| I-6 | avatar entity + input + movement + camera follow | planned |
| I-7 | talk trigger (adjacency + key) | planned |
| I-8 | dialog UI window | planned |
| I-9 | conversation VM (adapt legacy `script.js`) | planned |

**Why I-2 is the world-data system.** Loading the real world from `OBJBLK*`/
`objlist` into ECS entities is the clone's core purpose — the reason for choosing
ECS at all — and the heaviest architecture validation: the `SpatialIndex`
(`Map<cell→entity[]>`), the `ObjManager` dissolution (god-object → component
stores + spatial resource + systems), the per-cell chain Z-order, and the
`basetile` (obj_number → tile) decode all land here. It comes first after the
render slice so the ECS architecture is exercised on the real thing as early as
possible, and so I-1d's demo entities are replaced by the genuine populated world.
It folds in what was a separate "NPC entities (drawn)" step — NPCs are just
entities with `AIMode`+`Schedule`; their scheduled *behaviour* is I-5.

**Why I-3 → I-4 → I-5 in this order (NPC movement before the avatar).** NPC
scheduled movement is the prize (it never existed in the legacy port), so it comes
before the avatar — NPCs run on the sim/turn heartbeat (`TurnClock`), independent
of any player. Its two hard prerequisites come first: the **world clock** (I-3)
drives the hourly schedule lookup `C_1E0F_5165` (no clock → no "where should this
NPC be now"), and **tile passability** (I-4) is what the bucket-Dijkstra
pathfinder `C_1E0F_2D37` + movement-legality `C_1E0F_000F` walk on (object-blocking
comes from I-2's `SpatialIndex`). The avatar (I-6) reuses the same passability
primitive, so it slots in cheaply after. See `research_npc_ai.md`.

Steps past I-2 are the visible-progress trajectory, not a committed sub-step plan
— each step's real breakdown is written into its "scope" subsection when it
starts, after pre-impl research for its trickiest part. Deferred-to-later
subsystems (HUD, combat, magic, inventory UI, save/load, audio) fold in after the
β path lands.

## I-1 scope — terrain on screen

**Goal:** Britain's overworld rendered on canvas, drag-scrollable, with a few ECS
entities drawn through the real runtime core — so the first visible payoff doubles
as the first integration test of `architecture_ecs.md`'s runtime ground. Design
rationale + the renderer seam are in `research_i1_render_slice.md`; do not restate
them here.

**Renderer seam (locked):** reuse the legacy draw mechanism + terrain feed; drop
the `ObjManager`-coupled collection; lift `drawObject`'s marshal rules into the
RenderSystem *with* the pillar-bug fix (`research_map_render.md:603`); defer the
upload-strategy (full-rebuild for I-1's few entities). Tile flags live in
`TileRegistry` keyed by tile ID; `Renderable = { tileId }`.

**Sub-steps** (each ≈ one save-point commit, browser-verified before the next;
final squash → one `[ultima6_clone] impl I-1 (terrain on screen)`):

- **I-1a — ECS core skeleton.** `World` = generic container: allocator
  (`freeStack` + `generation[]` + `highWater`; `create` / `destroy` / `resolve`),
  component-store registration (plain SoA), 64-bit signature mask
  (`sigLo` / `sigHi`), `query` generator, `store(Comp)` handle, resource `Map`,
  two-list scheduler (`renderSystems` / `simSystems`) + frame fn
  (`poll → decide-turn → maybe-sim → render`). No rendering.
  *Verify:* in-memory test — spawn/destroy/query a few entities; a stale handle is
  caught by generation mismatch; query yields the right ids. Log to console.
  **DONE** — `ecs/world.js` + `ecs/test_core.html` (29/29 checks: generational
  stale-handle + slot reuse, 64-bit signature lo/hi boundary, capacity growth,
  TurnClock turn-driver fires on action/idle and suspends correctly).

- **I-1b — Asset pipeline as ES6 modules + data load.** Copy-then-own the legacy
  decoders (`palette_manager`, `tile`, `lzw_decoder`, `u6map`, `anim_data_manager`)
  as clean ES6 modules; wire the bring-your-own-data flow dropzone → `U6DB`
  (IndexedDB) → decode → `TileRegistry` resource (tile atlas + per-tile flags) +
  `MapLevel` resource (chunks + `worldTileIndex`). No bundled assets.
  *Verify:* checklist gate shows the required files present; log a known tile's
  flags read back from `TileRegistry`.
  **BUILT** — `assets/{lzw,palette,tiles,map,tile_flags,anim}.js`, `u6db.js`,
  `resources/{tile_registry,map_level}.js`, `index.html` + `main.js`. Dropzone
  supports **loose files OR a .zip** (dependency-free `assets/zip.js` using the
  browser's `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')`; basename-matched against the
  expected set, ultima7 pattern). Plumbing verified (modules import clean, U6DB +
  checklist gate work, zip round-trip 6/6 in `tests/test_zip.html`). **Decode
  VERIFIED on a real U6 zip** — all 11 files unpack, tile at (276,367) = "earth",
  file sizes match formats exactly.

- **I-1c — Terrain render.** `RenderSystem` draws the terrain layer via the reused
  `Shader` (`createLayer` / `updateLayer` / `render`) fed from `MapLevel`;
  `CameraSystem` handles drag-scroll (reuse the `mapOrigin` viewport logic) and
  re-queries terrain on move.
  *Verify (browser):* Britain visible at the default origin `(276, 367)`;
  drag-scroll repaints smoothly; no console/WebGL errors.
  **DONE** — `view/renderer.js` (TileRenderer: consolidated Shader + R8 atlas +
  palette texture; the GR_42-dispatch analog), `resources/camera.js`,
  `systems/{render_system,camera_system}.js`, canvas + rAF loop in `main.js`.
  Britain renders correctly on the user's real data (grass / animated water with
  sandy coastlines / buildings); pan verified (camera move re-fills + redraws); no
  errors. **Source-faithful render mechanics** (raw tile-ids first rendered
  transparent water bases as black): (1) apply the **animdata frame remap** before
  drawing — the legacy/Origin never draw raw water tiles (also gives animated
  water); (2) coastlines are a **two-layer composite** like the legacy/Origin —
  layer 0 base replaces shore tiles 16-47 with their water-base tile
  (`SHORE_TO_WATER`, map_viewer.js:150), layer 1 overlay draws the shore graphic
  on top (animmask-transparent pixels show the water through). Sub-pixel smooth
  scroll via a `u_scroll` uniform. Origin terrain-render comparison captured in
  `research_i1_render_slice.md §8`.

- **I-1d — ECS entity layer (the integration test).** Spawn a few
  `Position` + `Renderable` entities (e.g. a tree / sign from `objtiles.vga`);
  `RenderSystem` walks the `SpatialIndex` → `query(Position, Renderable)` →
  `TileRegistry` flag lookup → **corrected per-tile** layer routing + double-tile
  expansion → entity-layer sub-buffer → reused `Shader`.
  *Verify (browser):* entities render at correct world positions, stay anchored
  while the camera drags, and a double-height tile places its head cell correctly
  (the pillar-bug fix is exercised here).
  **DONE** — `components/components.js` (Position, Renderable),
  `systems/entity_system.js` (`EntityRenderSystem`), demo spawn + present step in
  `main.js`. Entities `query`'d each frame, double-tile expanded (C_1184_35EA), and
  routed **per-tile** to overlay layers 2 (lower) / 3 (top) by each tile's own
  `isTopTile` — the pillar-bug fix. Verified on real data: moongate (double-W) +
  skewer (double-H) render over terrain with transparency, stay anchored on pan;
  layer split 4 low / 1 top confirms per-tile routing. **Simplifications vs Origin
  (deferred to the object system):** layer model instead of the per-cell chain
  Z-order; `query`+viewport-cull instead of a spatial-index walk. Origin object-
  render comparison in `research_i1_render_slice.md §9`.

**Pre-impl research done:** `research_i1_render_slice.md` (render seam),
`research_map_render.md` (pillar-bug root cause + fix), `architecture_ecs.md`
(runtime ground). No further research blocks I-1.
