    - [in]
        - e: entity index
        - x, y: coordinates to test
    - [out]
        - true: (x,y) is within e's space, otherwise false

    - Box test (then whole e2 is checked agains the center of e1)
    - [in]
        - e1, e2: entity index
    - [out]
        - true: intersect, otherwise false
    - the test range
        - entity 1: x+0x05 to x+0x011, y to y+0x14

- u_envtest
    - Compute the environment flag
    - [in]
        - x, y: coordinates where to compute the environment flag
        - crawl: is rick crawling?
    - [out]
        - rc0: anything CHANGED to the environment flag for crawling
        - rc1: anything CHANGED to the environment flag
    - entity: width 24, height 21
    - tile: width 8, height 8
    - the usage of rc0 is to indicate the environment flag if possible from crawl to stand
    - the usage of rc1 is to indicate the environment flag for the whole space of the entity
    - x is added 4 for testing
        - the test range of x is from 4 to 20 if tiles columns aligned to 8
        - the test range of x is from 4 to 28 if tiles columns not aligned to 8
        - the number of tile column for check is 2 or 3 based on the tiles columns alignment
            - when x & 0x7 is not zero, need to test one more tile column
        - the number of tile row for check
            - for rc0, always 1
            - for rc1, the number of tile row for check starts from 1,
                - if not crawling, add 1,
                - if y & 0x7 is 4, 5, 6, or 7, add 1
    - x is not aligned to 8
        - for rc0, when crawling, check one tile row for rc0, otherwise rc0 = 0
            - flags for check: MAP_EFLG_VERT|MAP_EFLG_SOLID|MAP_EFLG_SPAD|MAP_EFLG_WAYUP
        - for rc1
            - flags not bottom:
                - for x0: MAP_EFLG_SOLID|MAP_EFLG_SPAD|               MAP_EFLG_FGND|MAP_EFLG_LETHAL|               MAP_EFLG_01
                - for x1: MAP_EFLG_SOLID|MAP_EFLG_SPAD|               MAP_EFLG_FGND|MAP_EFLG_LETHAL|MAP_EFLG_CLIMB|MAP_EFLG_01
                - for x2: MAP_EFLG_SOLID|MAP_EFLG_SPAD|               MAP_EFLG_FGND|MAP_EFLG_LETHAL|               MAP_EFLG_01
            - flags for bottom:
                - for x0: MAP_EFLG_SOLID|MAP_EFLG_SPAD|MAP_EFLG_WAYUP|MAP_EFLG_FGND|MAP_EFLG_LETHAL|               MAP_EFLG_01
                - for x1: all flags
                - for x2: MAP_EFLG_SOLID|MAP_EFLG_SPAD|MAP_EFLG_WAYUP|MAP_EFLG_FGND|MAP_EFLG_LETHAL|               MAP_EFLG_01
    - x is aligned to 8
        - for rc0, when crawling, check one tile row for rc0, otherwise rc0 = 0
            - flags for check: same as (x is not aligned to 8)
        - for rc1
            - flags not bottom:
                - for x0, x1: same as the one for x1 at (x is not aligned to 8)
            - flags for bottom:
                - for x0, x1: same as the one for x1 at (x is not aligned to 8)
    - MAP_EFLG_CLIMB indicates entities can climb
        - this flag is checked at the center columns and the bottom row of the entity for rc1
    - MAP_EFLG_VERT indicates entities can move vertically
        - this flag is checked for rc0 and the bottom row of the entity for rc1
    - MAP_EFLG_WAYUP: solid block, can't go through except when going up
        - this flag is checked for rc0 and the bottom row of the entity for rc1
    - if entity 0 exists, check if colliding with it when it's not lethal

- u_trigbox
    - Check if x,y is within e trigger box.
